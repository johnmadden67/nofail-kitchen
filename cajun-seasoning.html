  <!-- ===== WHY THIS EXISTS ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Why We Make Our Own</div>
    <div class="section-intro">This isn't about being fancy. It's about not poisoning yourself with salt you didn't ask for.</div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The most popular commercial Cajun seasoning in America — Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning — lists salt as its <em>first ingredient</em>. The original 1972 recipe was literally 26 oz of salt mixed with about 5 oz of spices. That's over 80% salt by weight. A single quarter-teaspoon serving has 340–380mg of sodium. A tablespoon — which is what many recipes call for — delivers around 1,360mg of sodium. That's 56% of your entire daily recommended limit in one spoonful of "seasoning."</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">This matters because Cajun recipes <em>already contain salt from multiple sources</em>. Think about our <a href="shrimp-and-grits.html">Shrimp &amp; Grits</a>: the chicken stock has sodium, the Parmesan has sodium, the bacon has sodium, the andouille sausage has sodium, the Worcestershire has sodium, and there's kosher salt in the grits. If you dump a tablespoon of Tony's on top of all that, you're well past 2,000mg per serving — a full day's limit for many adults.</p>

    <p>Our blend has <strong>zero sodium</strong>. You add salt separately, in amounts you choose, after tasting. That's not just healthier — it produces better-seasoned food, because you're in control.</p>

    <div class="compare-grid">
      <div class="compare-card bad">
        <div class="compare-label">Tony Chachere's</div>
        <div class="compare-val">380<span class="compare-unit">mg</span></div>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout note">
      <span class="callout-label">The hidden math:</span> In our Shrimp &amp; Grits recipe, we use 1½ tsp of Cajun seasoning. With Tony Chachere's, that adds ~2,280mg of sodium to the dish (570mg per serving). With our blend, it adds ~5mg. That difference alone is worth the 5 minutes it takes to mix this up.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== INGREDIENTS ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Ingredients</div>
    <div class="section-intro">Seven spices. You probably have all of them right now. Makes about ⅓ cup (enough for 8–10 recipes).</div>

    <table>
      <tr><th style="width: 140px;">Amount</th><th>Ingredient</th><th>Role</th></tr>
      <tr><td>2 Tbsp</td><td>Smoked paprika</td><td>The backbone — smoky depth and deep red color</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1 Tbsp</td><td>Garlic powder</td><td>Savory base, the most prominent flavor after paprika</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1 Tbsp</td><td>Onion powder</td><td>Sweet, rounded savoriness</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2 tsp</td><td>Dried oregano</td><td>Earthy, slightly bitter — the herbal anchor</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2 tsp</td><td>Dried thyme</td><td>Warm, slightly floral — pairs with the oregano</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1½ tsp</td><td>Black pepper, finely ground</td><td>Sharp heat and aromatic bite</td></tr>
      <tr><td>1–1½ tsp</td><td>Cayenne pepper</td><td>The heat — adjust to your tolerance (see notes)</td></tr>
    </table>

    <div class="callout tip">
      <span class="callout-label">Cayenne calibration:</span> 1 tsp gives a warm tingle that builds gently — pleasant for most adults. 1½ tsp gives a noticeable kick that lingers. If you're feeding kids or spice-averse guests, start at ¾ tsp. You can always add heat; you can't take it away. We recommend mixing at 1 tsp first, tasting on a fingertip, and adjusting up.
    </div>

    <div class="callout note">
      <span class="callout-label">Why smoked paprika instead of regular?</span> Regular (sweet) paprika adds color but is relatively bland. Smoked paprika provides the deep, campfire-like flavor that commercial blends get from the combination of chili powder and multiple pepper types. It's doing the heavy lifting in a salt-free blend where you can't lean on sodium to amplify everything else. If you only have regular paprika, use it — but know the flavor will be milder and you'll want to bump the garlic and black pepper slightly.
    </div>

    <div class="callout warn">
      <span class="callout-label">Check your spice dates.</span> Ground spices lose potency after 6–12 months. If your cayenne or paprika has been sitting in the cabinet for two years, it's contributing color but not much flavor. Smell it — if it barely smells like anything, replace it. This is especially important for a salt-free blend where the spices themselves are doing all the work with no sodium to boost them.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== METHOD ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Method</div>
    <div class="section-intro">This is not complicated. It barely qualifies as a recipe.</div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-header">
        <span class="step-num">Step 1</span>
        <span class="step-time">3 min</span>
      </div>
      <p>Measure all spices into a small bowl. If your oregano and thyme are leaf-form (not pre-ground), crush them between your fingertips as you add them to the bowl — this releases the essential oils and helps them blend evenly with the powdered spices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-header">
        <span class="step-num">Step 2</span>
        <span class="step-time">1 min</span>
      </div>
      <p>Whisk thoroughly until the color is uniform — you should see an even reddish-brown with no visible clumps or streaks of individual spices. Alternatively, put everything in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid and shake vigorously for 30 seconds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-header">
        <span class="step-num">Step 3</span>
        <span class="step-time">Taste test</span>
      </div>
      <p>Dip a clean, slightly damp fingertip into the blend and taste. You should get: smokiness first (paprika), then savory depth (garlic/onion), then warmth that builds (cayenne/black pepper), with an earthy herbal note underneath (oregano/thyme). If anything feels missing or flat, adjust now. The most common issue is not enough cayenne — people err on the side of caution and end up with a blend that's smoky but doesn't have any bite.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout check">
      <span class="callout-label">Look for:</span> A warm reddish-brown color. It should smell intensely aromatic — smoky, garlicky, and peppery all at once. If it smells like one thing more than everything else, adjust. The goal is balance.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== STORAGE ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Storage</div>
    <div class="section-intro">Make a batch, use it for months.</div>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Container</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Small mason jar (4 oz)</td><td>Best option. Airtight, easy to scoop from, looks nice on the shelf.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Recycled spice jar</td><td>Works great. Clean and dry completely before filling.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Zip-top bag</td><td>Fine for short-term. Squeeze out air before sealing.</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Store in a cool, dark place (not above the stove — heat degrades spices faster than anything). Best flavor within the first 3 months, perfectly usable for 6–12 months. Label it with the date you made it. If it stops smelling potent when you open the jar, it's time to make a fresh batch.</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
      <span class="callout-label">Double or triple it.</span> This takes 5 minutes to make. If you cook Cajun food regularly, make a big batch. ⅓ cup lasts 8–10 recipes; 1 cup will last you months and saves you from making it every time.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== HOW TO USE ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">How to Use It</div>
    <div class="section-intro">Rough guidelines for different applications. Since there's no salt, you can use more than you'd dare with commercial blends.</div>

    <div class="use-grid">
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Shrimp &amp; Grits</strong> — 1½ tsp</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Blackened fish</strong> — 1 Tbsp per lb</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Chicken thighs</strong> — 1 Tbsp per lb</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Jambalaya / gumbo</strong> — 1–2 Tbsp per pot</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Roasted vegetables</strong> — 2 tsp per sheet pan</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Mac &amp; cheese</strong> — 1 tsp stirred in</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Popcorn</strong> — ½ tsp tossed with butter</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Eggs / omelets</strong> — ¼ tsp per egg</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Grilled corn</strong> — ½ tsp per ear</div>
      <div class="use-item"><strong>Fries / potatoes</strong> — 1 tsp per serving</div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout note">
      <span class="callout-label">Remember:</span> Because this blend has zero salt, you <strong>must salt your food separately</strong>. If you're used to commercial Cajun seasoning, your first instinct will be that this blend tastes "flat" on its own. That's because you're used to tasting salt, not spice. Season with this blend first, then add kosher salt to taste. You'll be amazed how much more control you have over the final flavor.

  <!-- ===== HEALTH ANALYSIS ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Health &amp; Nutrition Analysis</div>
    <div class="section-intro">Per 1 teaspoon serving. Estimates based on USDA data for individual spices.</div>

    <div class="nutrition-grid">
      <div class="nut-card"><span class="nut-val">6</span><div class="nut-lbl">Calories</div></div>
      <div class="nut-card"><span class="nut-val">3<span class="nut-unit">mg</span></span><div class="nut-lbl">Sodium</div></div>

    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Beyond the sodium story, there are some genuinely positive health properties in this blend. Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, which has documented anti-inflammatory properties and may support metabolism. Garlic powder retains allicin compounds linked to cardiovascular health. Oregano and thyme are both rich in antioxidants — oregano in particular has one of the highest antioxidant concentrations of any dried herb. Smoked paprika is a good source of vitamin A.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">None of this means Cajun seasoning is a health food — you're using teaspoons, not cups. But it's a meaningful difference versus commercial blends where you're getting a tablespoon of salt with a dusting of these beneficial spices on top.</p>

    <div class="thin-divider"></div>

    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
      <div class="section-title" style="font-size: 22px;">The Sodium Comparison — In Context</div>
      <div class="section-intro">What the switch to homemade actually means across a week of cooking.</div>
    </div>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Tony Chachere's</th><th>Our Blend</th><th>Sodium Saved</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Shrimp &amp; Grits (1½ tsp)</td><td>2,280mg added to dish</td><td>~5mg added</td><td><strong>2,275mg</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Blackened chicken (1 Tbsp)</td><td>~4,560mg added to dish</td><td>~9mg added</td><td><strong>4,551mg</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Jambalaya (2 Tbsp)</td><td>~9,120mg added to pot</td><td>~18mg added</td><td><strong>9,102mg</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Weekly use (3 recipes)</td><td>5,000–15,000mg total</td><td>15–30mg total</td><td><strong>Massive</strong></td></tr>
    </table>

    <div class="callout warn">
      <span class="callout-label">Perspective:</span> The American Heart Association recommends no more than 2,300mg of sodium per day (and ideally 1,500mg for most adults). A single tablespoon of Tony Chachere's in a jambalaya dumps 9,120mg of sodium into the pot — that's <strong>four days' worth</strong> of the ideal limit. This is one of the highest-impact substitutions you can make in your kitchen.

  </div>

  <!-- ===== CAJUN vs CREOLE ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Cajun vs. Creole — What's the Difference?</div>
    <div class="section-intro">People use these terms interchangeably. They shouldn't.</div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Cajun cuisine comes from the rural French-Acadian immigrants in the bayou and prairie regions of Louisiana. It's rustic, pepper-forward, and built on the "holy trinity" of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Think one-pot dishes like gumbo, boudin, and crawfish boils.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Creole cuisine comes from New Orleans — a city cuisine with French, Spanish, African, and Caribbean influences. It's more refined, more herb-heavy, and often includes tomatoes (which Cajun cooking traditionally does not).</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Our blend sits somewhere in between — the smoked paprika and cayenne lean Cajun (pepper-forward), while the oregano and thyme lean Creole (herb-forward). It works beautifully in both traditions. Tony Chachere's, despite the common reference as "Cajun seasoning," is actually labeled "Original Creole Seasoning."</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
      <span class="callout-label">To push it more Cajun:</span> Add ½ tsp white pepper. White pepper has a sharper, more frontal heat than black pepper and is a hallmark of traditional Cajun seasoning. To push it more Creole, add ½ tsp each of dried basil and a pinch of ground bay leaf.
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== VARIATIONS ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Variations</div>
    <div class="section-intro">The base blend is versatile, but here are some targeted tweaks.</div>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Variation</th><th>Modification</th><th>Best For</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Extra Hot</strong></td><td>Double the cayenne to 2–3 tsp</td><td>Blackened fish, wings, people who mean it</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Mild / Family</strong></td><td>Reduce cayenne to ½ tsp</td><td>Kids, spice-sensitive guests</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Seafood Boil</strong></td><td>Add 1 tsp celery seed + ½ tsp ground mustard</td><td>Shrimp boils, crab boils, crawfish</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Blackening</strong></td><td>Add 1 tsp regular paprika + ½ tsp white pepper</td><td>Blackened fish or chicken (cook in cast iron, very hot)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Sweet Heat</strong></td><td>Add 1 tsp brown sugar</td><td>Grilled meats, roasted sweet potatoes, popcorn</td></tr>
    </table>

  <!-- ===== DEVELOPMENT NOTES ===== -->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Recipe Development Notes</div>
    <div class="section-intro">How we arrived at this specific ratio.</div>

    <table>
      <tr><th>Decision</th><th>Rationale</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Smoked paprika as backbone</strong></td><td>The consensus ratio across 8+ well-reviewed salt-free blends is 2 parts paprika to 1 part garlic to 1 part onion. We use smoked instead of sweet for more depth — critical in a salt-free blend where there's no sodium to amplify flavors.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>2:1 garlic-to-onion ratio</strong></td><td>Multiple sources use equal parts, but garlic powder is sharper and more aromatic. A slight garlic lean gives the blend more punch, especially on proteins.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Equal oregano and thyme</strong></td><td>Traditional Cajun blends lean heavier on thyme. Creole blends add oregano. We split the difference for maximum versatility. One actual Cajun reviewer noted they prefer it without the herbs — that's the pure Cajun approach, and it's valid.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Cayenne as a range (1–1½ tsp)</strong></td><td>Heat tolerance is the most personal variable in any spice blend. Giving a range respects that while still steering people toward a minimum that actually contributes flavor.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>No white pepper (in base)</strong></td><td>White pepper is traditional in Cajun blends but has a sharp, musty flavor some people dislike. We list it as a variation rather than a default.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>No salt, period</strong></td><td>The entire point. Every recipe on this site has a sodium audit. This seasoning exists so our readers can use Cajun flavor generously without unknowingly blowing past their daily sodium limit.</td></tr>
